The Digital Clock program is a simple application that displays the current time in a digital format. It is built using the Tkinter library in Python.

## Features

- Updates the time continuously every second.
- Adjusts the font size dynamically based on the window height.
- Resizes the clock label when the window is resized.

## Requirements

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to launch the Digital Clock application:

   ```shell
   python3 digital_clock.py
   ```
1. The application window will open, displaying the current time.

2. You can resize the window to see the clock label adjust its size accordingly.

3. To close the application, simply close the window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal/command prompt.
